## Before diving into the book

As a highly sensitive person, caring too much about what others think of me often makes conflicts in life feel incredibly draining. I used to rarely negotiate in daily life, and when I found myself at a disadvantage over small matters, I would first tell myself not to be difficult and choose to let things go. However, I developed negotiation skills throughout my career, and this book reminded me again that my empathy could be a strength, turning me into a good negotiator.

For example, not long ago, I ordered a takeout burger at a fast-food restaurant with separate counters and seating areas. After ordering, we waited in the seating area, out of sight of the counter. When our number was called and we went to the counter, I found the meal served on a dine-in plate. So, I carefully said:

*"I think I asked for takeout... Could you please pack it for me? Thank you."*

As expected, she firmly and directly said: 'You said it was for dine-in!' and then turned to ask her colleague to pack it without looking back.

On the way home, my friend asked me, 'What happened? I heard you say takeout too!' (implying why didn’t I correct her).

But that's just me, finding it hard to insist even when I know I’m right.

The same thing happens to me at the market. When I ask about the price of a pear and tentatively inquire about a discount, my timidness often makes it easy for vendors to dismiss my requests. Sometimes, it takes a bystander to step in and remind the vendor, 'You sold it to me for less last time!' before they grudgingly give me a discount. 

In addition to my habit of retreating from seemingly minor issues, I'm often taken aback when friends assertively handle customer service disputes, perceiving such actions as a **nuisance**. I've come to realize that my reluctance to assert myself stems from a belief that negotiation might not be effective and a fear of being criticized, which holds me back from even trying. This isn't beneficial for anyone involved in a negotiation. The author of the book discusses how settling for 'good enough' can be harmful, a perspective that I found particularly enlightening.


I really like how this book uses many cases to illustrate its points, and almost every point is made with a relatively balanced view, fitting the idea of adapting negotiation tactics to the situation and context.

Below, I'll share this book chapter by chapter:

## 'Bring Yourself' Book Review

*(Quotes from the book are presented in quotation marks. They have been translated back from Mandarin to English, so they may not exactly match the original text in the book.)*

Knowing my weaknesses, I've read many books on negotiation. I’ve found that almost all negotiation books, besides practical skills, emphasize that people are the key to negotiation - understanding and empathizing with the other party's needs is a crucial point mentioned in all negotiation books.

This book extends from the human foundation, emphasizing how we should care for **our own mindset** during negotiations. It advises observing not only the other party but also our own emotions to respond appropriately. But that's not all; I was pleasantly surprised to find that much of the book focuses on **women**, **introverted personalities**, and **multiculturalism**, as the author herself is a woman, from an Iranian immigrant family, and not a dominant negotiator. Perhaps because of these backgrounds, most examples in the book are not of negotiators who start with abundant resources. They often have weaknesses that we can all relate to, and they get stuck in common deadlocks during negotiation. The author, Mori, uses her classroom experiences to provide many ways to shift mindsets, offering new approaches to help us face the psychological fears often encountered in negotiations. I find it particularly useful for introverts and highly sensitive people who are easily influenced by others' perceptions.

The original title of the book is a perfect kickoff:

*Bring Yourself: Bring Yourself: How to Use the Power of Connection to Negotiate Fearlessly* 


---

At times, being a negotiation expert is seen negatively, as if it implies being opportunistic. But this book's purpose isn't to make readers experts in business negotiations; instead, it hopes to show the value of negotiation skills in **everyday life**. The first part of the book talks about obstacles at the negotiation table, the second about new mindsets. Mori uses business cases to share common blind spots and weaknesses, discussing how we can use business negotiation skills to face challenges in our personal lives. Mori believes **life is a negotiation, and even conversing with different aspects of ourselves is a form of negotiation** – a concept I hadn't considered. In fact, negotiation starts long before we actually sit down to talk with someone.

---

>Negotiation is life, and the more comfortable we are in negotiations, the more confident we are in our skills; the more we value ourselves, the more fulfilled we feel.

<br/>


## Part One: Obstacles at the Negotiation Table

### The Importance of Self-Awareness/Preconceived Positions

We often fall into the trap of tunnel vision because as humans, we can't produce the best solutions through parameters like machines. Instead, our personality traits and assumptions influence the outcomes of negotiations. The author starts with a classroom example of a student named Angela, who isn’t naturally assertive but feels the need to be dominant in negotiations. This forced persona didn't yield good results. Mori believes that being true to oneself is crucial in negotiations, finding and using your strengths in a way that suits you.

> Excerpt: "I often see people fall into this trap. People like Angela, willing to be accommodating in negotiations, often try to adopt a more aggressive persona, believing that competitive negotiators are usually winners and that nice people always lose."

> "They attribute their negotiation failures to not being tough enough. But when you're busy portraying a tough persona, you lose the ability to deploy the strategic skills and adaptability required in negotiations. There are many ways to deal with bullying negotiators, and one of the most powerful is to fully understand your leverage points."

In the workplace, I sometimes find myself in a similar mindset, especially when observing colleagues with more resolute and commanding personalities achieve results in a shorter time. I tend to introspect about my preference for soft negotiation and multiple rehearsals before finally forgetting my strengths and neglecting to review the actual reasons behind my negotiation successes and failures (which are not solely personality-related). I often doubt whether my lack of assertiveness is the reason I can't "win." While a less aggressive approach may not always lead to overwhelming success, it doesn't mean it can't help break through negotiation deadlocks.

Recently, while watching the series "Lincoln Lawyer," I saw how the main lawyer used the prosecution's preconceived positions to prove his client was being targeted. Despite the absence of a weapon at the crime scene, the prosecution still assumed guilt based solely on the presence of the suspect. If the actual perpetrator was someone completely undiscovered, then the trial focusing on a single suspect would completely miss the truth.

### Changing the Narrative

For the author Mori, the greatest negotiation in life is actually with oneself. She uses her story of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis eight years ago to illustrate how mindset impacts judgment. After her diagnosis, she constantly told herself a doomsday story until a neurologist pointed out that she had managed well over the past eight years with minimal symptoms, a remarkable feat in itself.

> "Changing your mindset means genuinely having the confidence to challenge certain fixed assumptions and considering all available information, not just the negative aspects."

Mori further uses her experience of co-founding a startup to highlight a common mistake people like us make – limiting our capabilities and yielding in front of those we perceive as more capable, because "the story I told myself was: I have a lot to learn, I lack confidence." Although looking back, she feels some of her concessions to her business partner were justified, she also realizes that she wasn't always wrong.

Just like the earlier story of receiving the wrong meal, such incidents have happened to me more than once. In the market, I tell myself I'm not a seasoned haggler, fearing vendors will see through any unrealistic prices I suggest. At work, I easily considered some issues trivial and choose to compromise and tolerate. I'm always afraid of being seen as difficult or unreasonable, so I end up being the one who swallows their pride, knowing I should fight for my rights but unable to convince myself to do so. This doesn't necessarily help the situation and might even prevent the team from seizing better opportunities.

> **"You can't be the one who undervalues yourself, because others will often do that to you."**
>
> **"The stories we tell ourselves shape us, define us, and affect how we negotiate with the world around us."**

These two quotes are very important to me. It's like writing a resume; do I include a year of experience where I didn't do anything significant? It's also a negotiation with myself. Sometimes I convince myself that my experiences are insignificant compared to others, but we all know that's not necessarily true.



### 'Good Enough' and How It Hurts You - Defining Your Self-Worth

This chapter is also quite intriguing. Mori talks about a student named Sam, who is reluctant to disrupt the status quo in negotiations. He frequently accepts less-than-ideal conditions, often emphasizing his own weaknesses instead of his strengths.

> "Such negotiators are hard to identify because no one thinks they are settling for mediocrity. Instead, they rationalize their behavior."
>
> "The focus on data that weakens their position stems from the fear of being criticized or seen as untrustworthy by opponents. Others look for values that can convince the other party, and might anticipate counterarguments, but **they don't start with this thought**. This order of thinking makes a significant difference."

Besides identifying the issue, Mori also presents two examples to show how to handle this habit of self-diminishment. She mentions a thirteen-year-old babysitter who confidently set her price, understanding her qualifications and the market rate, rather than letting others dictate her worth.

Another relatable story involves another student of Mori, the founder of a language institute, who hesitated to charge appropriately due to her young age, overlooking her proficiency in four languages and her natural teaching talent. She told herself: **"I'm just an inexperienced kid asking adults for money."**

Oh my, I can't count how many times I've told myself similar stories. Even after translating numerous books, I still considered myself an unqualified translator; after years in marketing, I still told my boss I didn't understand pricing strategies, doubting my decisions.

The author says: **"The process of weakening oneself is subtle, growing like a snowball until it leads to an avalanche."** We must remember that every effort and value has its price; offering them for free only becomes a habit. It's important to recognize our worth and reshape it. Perhaps I should remind myself that, although my translations aren't top-notch and my writing isn't the sharpest, I am experienced and have been praised by editors. When pricing strategies don't work, I should look at the real reasons behind the failure, rather than blaming my lack of assertiveness for not getting the price accepted. I believe this mindset will help me face more difficult challenges. In the next section of the book, Mori surprisingly addresses a challenging issue - gender stereotypes.

### Gender Labels Influencing Life Stories

Throughout my years of work, I've grown tired of all the labels about women, even those that sound like compliments, such as being more meticulous and considerate. These actually imply more 'expectations' (some feminists view this as a form of oppression). When women fail to meet these expectations, they are penalized, such as being labeled emotional when expressing strong opinions, whereas similar behavior by men is often seen as articulate and decisive.

Rather than just acknowledging these phenomena, I want to know how women can break free from these predicaments. Sometimes, knowing these issues exist makes it even more confusing on how to act. The book empathizes with women's positions before showing how men think, suggesting we can do the same.

> "Self-doubt is not limited to one gender, but in the stories I've heard, gender still plays a strong role."

Mori notes that many women are hard on themselves. When a better negotiation tactic is pointed out in class, they often say: "Yes, I know I could have done better." In contrast, many men's responses are unrelated to the negotiation outcome, often saying, "I think I did well in other areas."

>In an MBA peer study, Margaret Mayo wrote in the 'Harvard Business Review': **"Women quickly adjust their self-assessment based on peers' opinions, while men continue to rationalize and inflate their self-image. The research shows women are more sensitive to peers' opinions."**
>
>"Mayo notes: Absorbing negative feedback leads women to question their suitability and lowers their confidence, potentially hindering them from taking on new challenges."

These paragraphs remind me that having such traits isn't necessarily a disadvantage; it's more important to be aware of them and constantly decide whether to absorb negative feedback. The book mentions that women's **self-awareness is a great quality for negotiators**. You shouldn't be hard on yourself when others are already doing so. It's about tearing down labels, breaking expectations, and fully embracing oneself – **speaking up for yourself doesn't make you a bad person.** In subsequent chapters, Mori talks about how to utilize EQ and the mindset to handle internal imbalances:

>Women don't have to ask for less than others. What they need to do is focus on making their demands attractive. In preparation, women should not only understand their interests and set high goals but also consider the other party's perspective and interests. Here, EQ is key; understanding the other's emotions, reactions, and sensitivities allows you to navigate the dialogue accurately.
>
>"Using EQ doesn't mean compromising. Once I feel disrespected

, I clarify it immediately. And I've set high standards for how I should be treated, **not because I'm a woman, but because I'm a person**. I no longer struggle to speak up for myself." (But there's no need to be overly indignant either.)


<br/>

### The Moral Shield: The Collapse and Rebuilding of Self-Worth

My favorite sections of this book revolve around how to adjust our preset positions. Mori repeatedly discusses students believing that asking for too much in negotiations is exaggeration and deceit. However, she points out that this is self-destructive and diminishes humanity.

> They say, "I didn't get the best terms, but I didn't have to haggle with anyone. This makes me **feel** more humane, it doesn't matter." Negotiating with this worldview essentially diminishes your humanity.

Mori distinguishes between empathy and preset positions, urging readers to discern whether their retreat is rational or emotional. Often, we're overly concerned with empathy and morality, easily moving our own benchmarks backward. Like when I buy fruit at the market, I'm not inexperienced, nor ignorant of prices. However, when the price is higher than expected, I assume, "Maybe it comes from a better origin, or perhaps there's less yield this year," even if these assumptions aren't factual, and I rarely verify them. This willingness to avoid being seen as a difficult customer essentially allows others to overlook my needs.

Presuming about our own conditions, especially when we belong to disadvantaged groups, leads to self-doubt even before others begin to question us. The book’s solution is to be confident in finding our own way of negotiation. The more positive our narrative, the better the outcome.

> Which wolf you choose to feed, where you focus your energy, deeply affects our sense of self-worth and our ability to negotiate with the world around us.

This is an old Native American tale: in a fight between an evil wolf and a good wolf inside us, the winner is the one you feed, not necessarily the stronger one as we might think.


### The People-Pleaser

> **People-pleasers dislike conflict and avoid it at all costs.**

Mostly, Mori avoids leaning towards one side in her arguments. She emphasizes that while interpersonal relationships benefit negotiation, one should not neglect their own power and needs, sacrificing negotiation gains to maintain relationships.

In this section, she explains that people-pleasers don't have a stereotypical image; they're hard to recognize. We might think most are women, but it's not necessarily so. Many want to be liked, ensuring everyone is satisfied, but this comes at the cost of resentment, which can lead to a mental breakdown and missed negotiation opportunities.

>> **Avoiding negotiation is choosing to give up your power.**

>Sociotropy, common among women, involves caring deeply about interpersonal relationships and acceptance by others, leading to excessive accommodation.

I also appreciate the examples mentioned here, like footballers becoming ATMs for their relatives after landing high-paying contracts, creating resentment and making it harder to refuse later. Pleasing in one situation may lead to sacrifices in another, like over-tipping in a restaurant to avoid embarrassment, then not having the budget for dessert for the kids later.

Another relatable example under East Asian philosophy is being taught not to trouble others. If we need to bother someone, we instinctively apologize first. Hence in business emails, we often start with: "Sorry to bother you" or "Apologize for the inconvenience." The author also shared a similar instance where her friend advised her daughter to end a fundraising letter with "If it's not convenient, I completely understand." In essence, *we teach our children to shrink back before teaching them courage*, as people-pleasers, apart from fearing saying 'no', also hate hearing it.

It's essentially a fear of speaking up for ourselves, fearing rejection and unmet needs. We prefer to acquiesce or remain silent rather than face potential damage to our moral image, thus sacrificing our needs. This ties back to the previous section, ultimately based on our preset mindset changing our negotiation strategy. The solution is:

>Confirm whether your consent involves unrealistic expectations of your role. Don't blindly accept this definition; question it.

The emotionally extorted football player might eventually realize, "I feel they're taking advantage of me," but Mori asks:

**"Did you set boundaries?"**

This is an excellent strategy, and setting boundaries doesn’t mean we don’t care about loved ones, but rather acting **within our means**.

Moreover, Mori proposes an excellent idea: **viewing rejection as usable information**, demonstrating resilience to achieve success. If we don't refuse, we won't hear more information, nor have the chance to improve from rejection.

My own experience of being rejected from a job recently is a case in point. Only after not being hired did I realize I wasn’t proficient in Case Studies, nor had I systematically prepared my past work experience and business proposals. These are things I began to work on methodically afterward. Had I easily received the offer, I might still be in my comfort zone, thinking I was ready for tougher challenges.
<br/>


### 鬥爭算計VS爭取更多的骨氣

另一個本書中很精采的故事是關於韓國移民家庭的小孩紹熙，她在一個談判中只能有一方贏的環境中長大，所以她會壓抑自己，這樣才不用去衝撞，而父親的善良慷慨導致家計拮据，經常和母親吵架，這更加深了她認為：「不可能當個好人而不被踐踏」的心態。同時她還從小被教導韓國女性不需要表達自己的需求，更別談努力爭取。在上完課之後她才發現如果是為了別人，她也能積極談判的，為什麼就不能把那份力量轉向自己。

> 她意識到順從是一種習慣，成為她在世界上的生存樣貌，為了改變那個習慣，她必須打破自己無意識的行為，必須用好的談判經驗取代糟糕的經驗。
<br/>

接著她慢慢了改變認為談判只有一方贏的想法，而是盡力找到雙方都可行的解決方案。我覺得這部分是進一步闡述談判中容易誤判的狀況，因為誤判這場談判「零和」，就會讓我們錯失找出最佳談判點的空間，或是落入道德的枷鎖，認為這是鬥爭算計。

## 第二部 決勝新思維

第一章分析完談判的阻礙之後，接下來是討論怎麼去處理。莫麗在第二章一開始就點出實務上的談判技巧：要問自己真正要的是什麼，你的利益是甚麼，並且釐清兩者差異。莫麗用Google Map來解釋，其實利益就是要去的**目的地**，而前往目的地的**路線**就是談判立場。

> 利益是動機，不一定和對手相左。而立場是所有可以達成利益的方式。很多人會把兩者混為一談。

書中提到的例子是設想要和一個長期合作且高價值的客戶擬定新的合約，而基於公司收益的背景因素，業務想要談成更大的合約，這時候很多人以為真正的意義是談好價錢，但其實你無法承擔損失一個重要客戶的後果，因此這場談判中，資金挹注不是最重要的，維繫與這個客戶的關係才是——**你要知道自己上談判桌的理由**

這個觀點並不獨特，很多談判專家都會提到我們必須找到談判的真實利益才有可能找到真正的最佳解，不過這個問題對我來說仍然非常困難。在經過多年的練習之後，我才知道自己在談的**升遷**，主要目的並不是升遷這件事，而是想要**更好的薪水(當然!)，以及執行工作更有效率**。在我預設的想法裡，我以為升上主管薪水就會提升，升上主管以後就能直接和平行單位的主管談論事情，而不用想盡辦法拜託或說服，但後續大家應該都猜想得到，其實不一定要升上主管才能拿到更好的薪水，也不是升上主管在遇到跨部門紛爭的時候就更好解決，也就是說，我要達成的利益跟立場是脫鉤的，在理解自己真實的利益之後，在和主管談職涯的時候，心裡也比較舒坦了，而我要達成的利益，其實短時間有比*升遷*這個手段更好的作法。


在和家人起爭執的時候也是，比較能分辨出：現在我不開心的原因是因為有人動作太慢讓一家人太晚出門呢，還是只是因為當下太餓了，因為太晚出門要很晚才能吃到飯？所以才會生氣責怪對方：「你每次都……」

只是太餓的話，在別人拖拖拉拉準備的時間裡，可以趕快吃個巧克力呀 :P

<br/>

## 如何克服偏見陷阱——突破同溫層

>公平可能是個危險的詞，像是：對誰來說公平？用什麼標準來看公平？隨著每個人的價值觀不同，衡量公平的方式也必定不同。你需要換位思考，才能真正了解對方認定的公平是什麼。這完全取決於你看事情的角度。

談判技巧書中，幾乎100%都會提到要同理對方需求，這本書進一步討論到什麼才是對方的真實需求，並且反覆強調必須下功夫去研究，不能讓預設立場影響你的判斷。就像我連自己的需求其實是肚子餓都不容易發覺了，要挖掘對方的真實需求想必是更困難的，同時不用自己的觀點去界定公平本身也是件不直覺的事。

莫麗認為和非同溫層的人說話對任何談判都是必要的，因為只向同溫層尋求建議，很容易受到驗證性偏誤(confirmation bias)。而且我們必須了解抵抗驗證性偏誤不是只對別人好，多元化對自己的組織發展也很好。


>「請讓自己一直處在「尋找事實」的模式，而不是被腳本綁住，要保持好奇心，而不是尋求確定感。」要對人有好奇心。即使針對同一件事，你和對方的觀點也可能南轅北轍。

而對於內向人應該如何去獲取這些資訊，這本書也給了一個很好的信心建立方式，內向的人如果突然要使出渾身解數來成為焦點感覺會很狡詐，所以莫麗的做法是展現自己真誠的好奇心，像是她是一個鞋控，就可以真誠的和對方聊起鞋子再自然的延續對話。這樣的技巧當然也不只限於談判。

<br/>

## 同理，雙贏談判的秘密武器

在談判桌上讓利，也稱為雙贏談判，但莫麗對這個名詞很小心，因為這可能帶來誤解。雙贏這個說法案是每個人都拿到想要的，但其實不是這樣。雙贏的意思是，雙方在結束談判時，都覺得情況比談之前來得好。這本書就提到一個研究結果顯示：當開價立刻被對方接受，出價的那一方會比較不滿意這個決議；而在談判過程中即使自己拿到最多錢，對手卻負氣、怨恨、覺得被騙，這也不是真正的成功，顯示感覺還是重要的

> 雙贏不表示雙方都得到自己想要的，而是彼此都讓出不太重要的利益，以滿足己方最重要的利益。

> 對於成功的談判者來說，同理心並不是一項「有也很好」的特質，而是「必備」特質。

不知道同理對方，不會知道如何妥協，也不會知道在哪裡讓步對方會很有感。


<br/>

### 真正的聆聽／專注力

比較近期的策略書裡面也經常提到專注力的重要，談判期間為什麼需要專注基本上不用再詳述了。現代社會太強調多工了，許多人在與人來往的時候，仍會不停的查看訊息，但我想幾乎每個人都有這樣的經驗：在和主管或同事談話的時候，對方不時查看信件、回覆訊息的狀況讓你覺得這段談話的結果是不可信的，是徒勞無功的，因為你在講的話對方可能沒有真正聽進去 (甚至對方還會覺得：有啊，你剛說這個案子你說要更多預算我聽到了——談了好幾遍了，跟上面爭取太麻煩了，不想處理——但可能沒有聽到你會如何平衡收益，也沒聽到你幫對方解決了多少爭取預算的困難)；反過來說，一個平時非常忙碌的主管如果願意在午餐面談時拋開手機，即使他只是在看著餐盒裡的東西，也相對讓人感受到信任。

不專注會付出忽略許多細節的代價，影集《林肯律師》就透過觀察陪審團的言談、表情細節來判斷他們是不是己方需要的陪審員，也透過當事人摸膝蓋的小動作發現他在說謊。這本書也提到專注力的重要性，不過特別的是，茉莉認為**科技確實是令人分心的重大因素，但我們碰到的麻煩不只是智慧型手機而已**。

>「聆聽本來就不是件容易的事，我是指真正的聆聽，**而不去想接下來要說什麼**，也沒有任何主張」<br/>

莫麗提到一個談判課的經典練習——在《哈佛這樣教談判力(Getting to Yes)》這本書中，用一個隱藏的訊息提示學員：談判的雙方在爭搶柳橙，但一個只要皮，一個要果肉，結果還是有許多學生犯錯，在談判時爭取其他部分，甚至始終都認為自己的那方需要整個柳橙。(其實那個資訊就寫在活動單上)

接下來她繼續強調積極聆聽(active listening)的重要：

>「大部分人聆聽時並不是想要理解對方，而是為了回應對方」—Stephen Covey (《與成功有約》)

而如果我們擔心對方會問自己的看法，怕自己沒準備怎麼接話，其實都可以允許自己好好吸收資訊再思索回應，請求對方給自己一點時間。莫麗解釋人很難在談判中積極聆聽的原因，部分是因為人們通常一開始就對談判焦慮，影響了專注力，而能改善這件事的做法在於準備談判時，**對情緒也要預作準備**。

<br/>

### 管理情緒的談判藝術

書中提到的例子和我遇到的事情高度相似，在我過去工作的職場上，有個許多人都認為非常難對付的資深高階主管，她非常有經驗和專業，在自己的領域很有權威，因此在別人提出對她來說不合理的要求時就會情緒激動，用非常大的音量和教訓的口吻反駁，並且不願意再繼續對話，她身上幾乎融合了所有談判上大家都不樂見的特質。

書中的人物是梅麗莎，同樣是一個蠻橫的人，經常劈頭就攻擊別人，因此書中的談判對象安妮就安排了一個一對一的咖啡會面，在這次會面中，安妮才察覺梅麗莎其實很沒有安全感，她需要討拍取暖。

>「如果梅麗莎有了安全感，那他就能傳達出真正的想法，而不是沉溺在撥弄事非。」<br/>

而我在和那位高階主管多次交手的過程中就經常運用別本書的談判的技巧，盡可能去聆聽和同理。而巧合的是，手上這本《華頓情緒談判課》無獨有偶的提到安妮在單獨和梅麗莎會面以前就先把所有梅麗莎會惹怒她的情況都想過一遍——我自己也這樣做了。是因為在幾次經驗中，我意識到自己非常容易在氣憤之下感到委屈而錯失答覆的機會，也很擔心自己在不恰當的時機**自以為冷靜**的回嘴，因此在某次會議前我便把所有資深主管可能會飆罵的內容全部都設想了一次，並且準備了非常完整的資料、演練了所有答覆，甚至修改了所有我自己認為會激怒她的詞彙和內容。在準備的過程中，我發現她容易情緒激動的原因是因為她扛著非常大的責任，她必須對自己的團隊負責，也了解到大概什麼類型的話語會讓我失控，可以透過練習來化解(例如：「你們怎麼都不先準備！」每次聽到這些話，我都會很氣惱，因為我覺得我**確實準備**了，但現在的我就會告訴自己：她這麼說是她的感覺，與我無關，不需要為這些話動怒)。

沒想到後來那場要爭取她同意的會議因此變得異常順利。一開始不出所料，她對我們提出的請求提出了嚴苛的指責，有些乍聽之下都很不合理，但在理解對方提出這些論點其實只是想保護公司利益以及團隊後，就能平心靜氣的抓準時機好好回覆她的質疑、分享可以透過什麼方式來解除她的疑慮。最後的成果大出我的預料之外，她的情緒很快就安穩了下來，最後也按照我們的需求去促成這個案子。

<br/>

當然案子成功本身也非常重要，但對我來說，成功的達成談判的目的，也成為未來更勇於談判的墊腳石，因為現在我知道，只要我夠專注、夠有準備，在談判場合上就不會受我自己的情緒左右誤判情勢。不諱言的說，在這場會議以前，我總覺得談判書的內容部分有點打高空，對於**不可理喻**的人怎麼可能有用呢？但實際證明不是沒有用，而是沒有用對。

<br/>

### 豐足心態

豐足心態是另一個讓我們能夠更有餘裕面對談判的心態，這裡莫麗又舉出了女性在職場上因為高階位置稀缺的因素而容易變成在女性內部惡性競爭，但假使我們都知道這些條件並不稀缺，談判就能更有彈性，也更能思考和對手互利。

>「太好了，我們談了一筆好交易。我們是不是可以讓它更好？」

而除了免除無謂的競爭之外，重新爬梳是否還有其他合作的機會，把每個交易都當作未來有機會再合作也能實現另一種雙贏。另一個貫穿這本書的核心要旨「以利益為基礎的談判是解決問題，而非獲勝」，而這並不是天真的作法。

>「你絕對不想抱著絕望感踏入談判，或是覺得必須達成協議才算圓滿」

>「有些人會堅持，對付霸凌者最好的做法是以其人之道還治其人之身，老實說我看不出這有甚麼道理，這樣做並不會讓對方尊敬你，相反的，了解自己的施力點才會讓對方尊敬你，畢竟，和霸凌者談判，沒有比了解自己的力量還好的做法。」

我覺得這幾個小節，都在強調「可能性」以及打破框架，只在乎談判桌上的籌碼，的確會讓我們錯失很多沒有看到的策略，而把我們的目光帶往遠處的，就是不認為資源稀缺的**豐足心態**，如果我一直糾結公司的高層主管只是想激怒所有人，做事沒有合理性，而能夠影響時局的做法是找另一個高層以暴制暴，那可能只會陷入另一個惡性循環，也無法鍛鍊自己的溝通能力。

在離開前一份公司之前發送離職信的時候，我最意外的就是當初那個屢次在會議上飆罵我的高階主管居然也寫了一封信給我，稱許我是很聰明的員工，這大概也是豐足心態的收穫之一。

<br/>

### 脆弱的力量

正如這篇文章一開始提到的，這本書讓我們知道安靜內向的人也能上談判桌。莫麗提到其中一個學員的心態：「我的對手很狡詐，每個人都想贏，我非常尷尬，我人太好了，很容易上當。」但上完課後她也掌握到談判是真誠開放的面對**自己**和他人，說出自身的需求，並不表示一定要揭露一切，但她也能夠決定跟別人說什麼以及如何說，甚至展現脆弱也是一種方式。

並不代表我想要便宜買水果，就要違背良心和個性臭罵攤販：「你怎麼賣我那麼貴？算便宜點啦！」或許可以說：「今天只剩下一百塊，這個可以算我一百塊嗎？」或是「上禮拜是賣一百塊呢，這禮拜價格變了嗎？」甚至也可以選擇不買(離開談判桌)。

看完這段剛好要去簽一個健身房的合約，我就嘗試練習了一下。以前覺得殺價很厚臉皮，但改成把自己的真實狀況——目前沒有多餘的預算，手頭很吃緊——說出口以後，要談合約價格的心理負擔也比較不那麼重了，也用調整上課頻率的方式來達成我的需求，最後我不僅沒有傷害到對方，也不用像以前一樣拐彎抹腳說不恰當的理由，導致日後見面更尷尬。

<br/>

### 持續對談的勇氣

在本書的最後，莫莉除了重申談判無所不在，也舉出另一個故事來撫平我們的傷口。在她的一個課堂上，學生蘇菲說：「我跟諾亞談判，他大大擊敗了我，畢竟他是猶太人」。這段話引發了討論，許多人為她向諾亞道歉，有的人說道歉的人是偽善，因為每個人都有刻板印象，蘇菲只是說出來了而已，而其他人則認為蘇菲雖然不是故意的，但說出來的話仍很傷人。

> 如今時移世變，猶太人覺得被針對，少數族群覺得被針對，女性覺得被針對，男性覺得被針對。面對這個景況，每個人腦中不免時常浮現魯莽一詞，但是有人做事不經大腦時，我們多半是避談這個主題而不是進一步去處理它

這樣的狀況太多了，網路上針對各種議題爭論不休，最後兩派一翻兩瞪眼，但鮮少有人願意卸下心防再好好理解彼此。在這個例子中，莫麗鼓勵同學去找蘇菲談話，最後蘇菲也回到課堂上了，這段格外令人感動，在這個故事裡沒有一個人是壞人，如果我們能放下：「會種族歧視的人一定是壞人」的想法，也就有機會改變她對其他族群的刻板印象了。

> **儘管我們魯莽冒失，但我們攜手解決問題，我們有勇氣待在棘手的談判桌上，而且下週仍會重返談判桌**

很難用文字來形容看到這完的心情，除了書的內容本身就很紮實以外，這本書的譯筆也非常優異(很讓人羨慕T.T)，我在讀這本書時幾乎沒有停下來，順手抄了不少佳句，對我來說最有意思的是，許多談判書都會提到商務技巧，但我們不是每天都要談幾K幾K的大案子，卻可能每天都要跟家人溝通要吃什麼晚餐、跟同事談resource要怎麼分、會議室要怎麼喬，這本書提到的案例都能幫助我們一步一步練習許多重要的談判技巧，也讓大家知道，談判沒有想像的負面，並不是只有爾虞我詐的環境才需要談判，談判是一種促進人際關係的裡面，是以同理為核心的技術。

正如全書的結語：**談判能讓世界更好**
